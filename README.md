EStore is an application that allows you to view a list of available products. 

You can view the live project hosted on github pages : https://hpkolse.github.io/Angular-Web-app/

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.0.

## Project Motivation

This project demonstarates my Angular skills implementaion to a real time scenario. I have demonstrated various important Angular skills such as:
- Making use of Angular Reusable Compoonents.
- Angular Routing
- Angular Service and making use of HTTP GetClient to fetch data from a dummy JSON file(Could be integrated with a real time api)
- Following standerd coding practices

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
